# PL_Fantasay

This project is called PremierZone. It is a comprehensive platform designed to:

Scrape match statistics for over 700 football players using Python and pandas.
Dynamically manipulate and present this data through a Spring Boot backend.
Store and manage data in a PostgreSQL database.
Provide a user-friendly frontend built with ReactJS.

The project is organized into four main components: Backend, Frontend, Data Scraping, and Machine Learning. The frontend communicates with the backend via REST APIs, and the backend handles data processing and database interactions.
